The application https://knhts.health.go.ke use the javaScript framework NEXTJS as the frontend application.
NEXTJS has a backend feature which allows it to make request at the backend and provide the data to the UI 
in realtime unlike reactjs which handles all the request from the UI

The frontend application is supported by a backend application which is running from IP address 41.89.92.186 
from an application running on port 8000.
The backend application is most likely running on pytho django

The separation of the backend and frontend is a good thing, however this can be disastrous if one fail, eg.
if the backend fail the UI will still make request and give the user a false output or outdate output incase of cached data in the frontend application

Since python-Django is an ORM, it would be wise to have the application coupled into one so as to reduce the points of failures.

Django has a templating engine which can be used to do the UI in the coupled application.

Also this will enable the application to enjoys rich django features

The front end work was not completed fully. Time limitation
